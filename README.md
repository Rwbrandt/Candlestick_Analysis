# Candlestick Predictions
-----
## Core Hypothesis
- Can machine learning increase the returns resulting from the implementation of a candlestick charting trading strategy? 
-----
## Data Utilized
- Historical Eterium Prices from January 6th 2022 to January 26th
    - 5 minute intervals
- Dataframe of 6,000 entries
- over 60 Candlestick functions to generate buy or sell signals

-----
## Models Utilized
- Random Forest
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- LSTM Neural Networks
- SVM Models
- eXtreme Gradient Booster
-----
## Training Process
- Random Forest
