# Candlestick Predictions
-----
## Core Hypothesis
- Can machine learning increase the returns resulting from the implementation of a candlestick charting trading strategy? 
- Is there a Machine Learning model that can produce positive returns?
- Can our position be optimized for the best returns possible?
- Which Machine Learning method would produce the best results?
- What division of assets provides us with the best overall results?
-----

## Conclusions and Predictions
### Conclusions
- All Machine Learning algorithms performed better than the market
- Highest Machine Learning return was the LSTM Matching at 3.6%
- Highest overall return was candlestick signals, with 33.5% returns

## Moving Forward
- 300 year old methods can still perform effectively in a highly volatile market of cryptocurrency
- Adding in Machine Learning models can assit and improve returns even in a downward trending market!
